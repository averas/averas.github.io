            <p class="paragraph">In this workshop you will analyze a mockup dataset to determine which B2B (business) customers
                Tele2 should go after! Your job is to first explore the dataset using an interactive visulisation, and then - when
                you understand the data better - produce an algorithm that does the job for you automatically. This is a
                very common approach in data-driven organisations like Tele2. The pre-processing of data and visualisations for the workshop is entirely produced using JavaScript, one of many languages we use, especially for visualisation.</p>

            <div class="section-header">üïπ GETTING TO KNOW THE DATASET</div>
            <p class="paragraph">The dataset represents roughly 4000 office locations in the greater Stockholm area.
                Each datapoint is one office location with some attributes describing the characteristics of the office. The black/purple markers are Tele2 network hub sites, where we can connect customers. Your task will be to determine how we should
                prioritise the offices for marketing, based on their attributes. There is no <i>right</i> way of
                doing this, and reflecting over multiple angles is part of the workshop! Start by playing around with the <a href="demo/" target="_blank">interactive visualisation</a> while reading about the different data dimensions below. When you feel that you have a basic understanding for the dataset it's time for you to write some code! üòä</p>

                    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left;">All offices in the dataset belong to a company with a certain yearly income, or revenue. Arguably, companies with higher revenue may generate more business for us. You can select the REVENUE mode in the visulisation and filter offices based on revenue in the filters to the right. How important is revenue when finding potential customers?</p>

                    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left;">The black/purple markers on the map represent network hub sites where we can connect customers with leased lines. The cost of leased lines goes up with distance, so we might prefer connecting offices that are close to our sites. Select the COST mode in the visualisation and get a feel for how leased line cost goes up with distance to the nearest network site.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left;">Although each data point only represents a single office, there is information on the data points on how many offices the parent company has in total. An important business opportunity for communication providers like Tele2 is interconnecting offices with each other, therefore companies with many offices may be more attractive customers than companies with fewer offices.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left;">As mentioned above, leased line costs between our network hubs and customer offices impact the business case for any single office significantly. One way of approaching this is to lease lines between local customer deployments, which can be much shorter distances. This means that "clusters" of offices with many nearby offices (regardless of company) may be more attractive than isolated offices.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left;">Tele2 values sustainability very high and has several ongoing initatives to reduce environmental footprint and to be in the forefont of sustainable business. As the first telco in the Nordics and the Baltics, Tele2 is now climate neutral in its own operations, consuming 100 percent renewable electricity and offsetting remaining emissions. We just launched our new sustainability strategy where we are committed to lead in sustainability, read about it <a href="https://www.tele2.com/sustainability/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please discuss with your peers how and to what extent this could be incorporated into your algorithm .</p>

                    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left;">Another important area for Tele2 is equality. In 2020, International Equileap ranked Tele2 number one on gender equality among Swedish OMX30 companies and we drive an ambitious diversity and inclusion agenda, which you can read about <a href="https://www.tele2.com/sustainability/our-sustainability-strategy/diversity-and-inclusion/" target="_blank">here</a>. Like with sustainability this could also be a factor in whom we direct our business efforts towards. Discuss in your group if, why and how equality scoring could be part of a business model.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">You have now interacted with the dataset and hopefully have a feeling for its different dimensions and their characteristics. Now it's time to write an office scoring algorithm for the marketing department! As you may have noticed in the visualisation, the score for all offices is uniformly distributed between 0 and 100. Your job is to write a new scoring function that, based on the different dimensions, prioritises offices for business. Head over to <a href="https://codepen.io/averas/pen/zYKVpPL/left?editors=0010" target="_blank">CodePen</a> and start working on your scoring function. You can see a couple of examples here below and more instructions over at CodePen. The table in the visualisation shows your top ranking office locations. At the end of the workshop we'll compare results and discuss your approach. <br/><br/>Good luck!</p>
